# Webmake for LCP

## Description

In March 2023, I took a course named "Macromolecules - From Materials to Life" in Nanjing University. It seemed to be a course for chemistry students, but it required everyone in class to form several groups and design one website on a particular topic. 

So 4 other students and I formed a group, concentrating on LCP. We made our website in several weeks.

The site of the course is [https://wbhu.nju.edu.cn/](https://wbhu.nju.edu.cn/).
